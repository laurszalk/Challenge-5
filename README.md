# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

- This app is a work day scheduler for the user to save tasks and appointments during the work day. It uses Day.js, Jquery, Bootstrap, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## What does the Work Day Scheduler do?

- When you load the scheduler the user will see the current day and time at the top of the page.
- The scheduler is color coded by time block for the user so that they can quickly identify if a task for that day has passed, is happening now, or will happen in the future. Gray indicates the time has passed, red indicates it is the current time, and green indicates the event is upcoming.
- When the user saves an appointment or task, it will save it to their computer's local storage.
- When the user leaves the page and reopens the scheduler, the events and appointments are still visible.
